Scenario:
A customer will arrive to the service center and check-in by giving the following information.

Name:

Service Type: One or Many of [Sim Replacement / Bill Settlement / Sim Cancellation / New Connection / Bill Discrepancies]
Customer will receive the token with appointment number and the service desk number. 

Staff members are capable of servicing one or more service types. The service types each member can cater are pre-configured. Allocated duration for each appointment is 15 minutes. The appointment slots are scheduled as 9 - 9:15, 9:15-9:30, 9:30 -9:45 â€¦.

The system should be capable of assigning the right staff member to the appointment so that the average wait time will be minimized.

There should be a screen to view ongoing appointment number in each service desk. 
The admin should be able to view the average wait time.
